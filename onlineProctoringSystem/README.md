# onlineProctoringSystem-

TITLE : Online proctoring using Computer Vision.

OBJECTIVE :
This project aims at developing a proctored monitoring system which would cater
to the needs of online examinations. The project will be a supervision service provided to
all those institutes that have virtual examinations. This basically will consist of
monitoring the student through his webcam, this project will seeks to study in real time,
the actions and the environment of the student while he is performing the test, with the
intention of making sure that such student is not using any resource support like mobile
phones or human support using Artificial Intelligence.

METHODOLOGY / TECHNOLOGY :
 Python libraries
 Tensor flow
 skLearn
 nltk
 numpy
 pandas
 dlib
 Flask
 Werkzeug
 Machine learning algorithms
 Open CV
POSSIBLE OUTCOMES :
 Making logs of window events whenever user changes tab or opens a new tab.
 Detection of Mobile phone.
 Detection of More than 1 person in the exam.
 Taking Students images logs at every 5 seconds.
 Detection of missing person.
 CUT, COPY, PASTE, Taking Screenshots Function is disabled.

UTILITY :
 It can be used by various universities, institutions and other organizations to proctor
students during online examination.
 IT firms, MNCs can use this to assess candidates during hiring process.
 It provides an online platform for usage of the service along robustness of new dataset.
